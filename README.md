# 6th-Sem-Minor-Project-Zeroshot-Learning
In this project we aim to use zero shot learning by using Word2Vec Text Embeddings for classes and AWA2 dataset as our base.This is different from using direct AWA2 embeddings for training and testing.

We will also compare the results with classic deep learning architectures to show how much difficult it is to classify unseen data.

The embedding used:Word2Vec is a open source file developed by google which can be downloaded from internet and will not be present in the repository.

Similarly, the AWA2 dataset developed by The Institute of Science and Technology Austria, is also available on internet and will not be present in the repository.
